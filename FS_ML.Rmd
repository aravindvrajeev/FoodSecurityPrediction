## Research Question

- Can we build an early warning system of food security in areas where data is scarce and data collection is costly ? (Hutchinson,1991)
    + Timely and accurate targeting is essential for aid and humanitarian responses 
    
- How to make use of publicly available and economically meaningful data to fill the data gap? 
    + Price data of the main agricultural markets are collected monthly or weekly 
    + Precipitation/temperature/soil quality from remote sensing are relevant to agricultural production 
    + Distance to roads and markets reflects access to market and information

 -  Use supervised learning approach that to achieve higher predicative power and remain interpretable.

## Preview of Results

  - Out-of-sample predictions from our model explains up to 50%-67% of cluster level variations in Malawi and up to 76% in Tanzania for HDDS and FCS measures.  
    + 0.4 r^2^ on consumption expenditures and 0.6 r^2^ on  asset index (Jean *et al*., 2016)
    + 0.76 r^2^ on WI and 0.27 r^2^ on income in Bangladesh (Steele *et al*,2017)
  
  - Using the same sets of features, a machine learning model outperforms a baseline linear model by 20 - 50% in high dimensional settings. 

  - Decreased the proportion of estimates that overestimate Food Security outcomes 

  - Validates the "A Prototype for Predicting Food Insecurity Using Readily Available Data" paper with Tanzania.

## Literature Review

  - Night lights data (Chen and Nordhaus 2011;Henderson *et al*. 2012.) does a good job at predicating economic activity but the variation is little in areas of the extreme poor or in urban areas. 
  
  - Mobile phone data (Blumenstock *et al.*,2015; Steele *et al*.,2017) is complimentary to remote sensing data but expensive.
  
  - Very High resolution satellite imagery are becoming cheaper but highly unstructured and contains measurement error (Engstrom, 2018; Donaldson and Storeygard, 2016). 
  
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models (Jean *et al*., 2016; Babenko *et al*. 2017) explains average 46% of the variation at village level but requires an enormous amount of training data and are computationally extensive. Interpret-ability and repeat-ability are less promising.
   
## Framework

- Understanding of food security. The definition of food security has various characteristics. The use of metrics can lead to quite divergent rankings of the same population (Steele *et al*. 2017)

- Geo-referenced household surveys (LSMS data) allow us to explore the spatial-temporal variations in food security measures.

- The sampling framework allows us to observe a nationally representative HH sample in different months and agroecological zones. 

- Explain these variations by the spatial-temporal variation in food availability and in food access.
    + Align weather data to crop growing season 
    + Align households to the most relevant market price

- Utilize the interaction and higher order terms of the variables

## Indicators to measure food security 

 - Dietary diversity and food frequency 
 
       + Food Consumption Score (FCS)
       
       + Household Dietary Diversity Scale ( HDDS )
       
       + Captures quality and diversity 
     
 
 - Consumption behaviors 

       + Reduced Coping Strategy Index (rCSI)
       
       + Capture the element of quantity or sufficiency

##  Predication 

- Split the entire sample into training and testing 
- Use Malawi 2010 to predict Malawi 2013; and a randomly split training and testing sample for Tanzania

## Overfit 

Avoid over-fit by using simple models, cross-validation, regularization, ensemble learning

## Models 
 
 -  Set of models deal with high dimensional problem with different types regularization 
 -  Maximum Likelihood plus a constraint ( same interpretation )
 
    + Lasso (L1 norm, prefers smaller model)
    + Ridge (L2 norm, prefers large model)
    + Elastic Net (Combination of the two)
 
 - Ensemble leaning models that are great with positively skewed and high dimensional data: 
    + Random Forest 
    + Gradient boosting

## Data
 
 - Price data (maize and rice price and market thinness at the nearest district market)
 
 - Weather 
     
     + Total rainfall in growing season (October to April)
     + Maximum of days without rain 
     + First day of rain
     + Mean temperature
     + Growing degree days (days that average temperature between 5-32 Degree Celsius) (Deschenes and Greenstone 2007)
   
 - Soil quality: slope, elevation, soil nutrition 
 
 - Roof/floor type, household asset index
 
 - Mobile phone ownership: access to financial resources, remittance flow and economic (Eagle *et al* 2010, Blumenstock *et al* 2016)

## Discussion of Results

- Increase in predication accuracy 
- Variables in the Lasso (maize/rice price and distance to market, assets index, household demographics, soil nutrient availablity)
- Feature importance in Random Forest (nutrient availablity, rice price, assset index, number of cellphone, temperature and day1rain)
- compared to a simple linear predication, ML model predications are less spread out. 
- ML models predications tends to overestimate on the higher end and underestimate the lower end
- Still does poorly on the RCSI measure (because of its positively skewed distribution)

## Future Steps 
 - Address the issue of overestimating the food insecure households
 - Interpret the interaction terms 
 - Trained on a pooled data set across different countries V.S. Fit models on each individual country with the same procedure
 - Predict "now": countries/areas that are not surveyed and suggest areas that are likely to have a food shortage. 
 
### Limitations 
 - limited to gradual food insecure cases and can't predict sudden, abrupt threat to food security (natural disaster, war and conflict)
