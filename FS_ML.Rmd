## Research Question

- Can we build an early warning system of food security in areas where data is scarce and data collection is costly ? (Hutchinson,1991)
    + Timely and accurate targeting is essential for aid and humanitarian responses 
    
- How to make use of publicly available and economically meaningful data? 
    + Price data of the main agricultural markets are collected monthly or weekly 
    + Precipitation/temperature/soil quality from satellite imagery are relevant to agricultural production 
   
 -  Find the supervised learning approach that has higher predicative power but remain interpretable.

## Preview of Results

  - Predictions from our model explains 50%-70% of cluster level variation and the result is consistent across three different countries in different years. 
  
  - Validation of  "A Prototype for Predicting Food Insecurity Using Readily Available Data" paper with three countries and seven years of training data.
  
  - Using the same sets of features, a tuned machine learning model outperforms a baseline linear model by xylem %. 
    
## Literature Review

  - Night lights data (Chen and Nordhaus 2011;Henderson et al. 2012.) does a good job at predicating economic activity but the variation is little in areas of the extreme poor or in urban areas. 
  
  - Mobile phone data (Blumenstock et al.,2015; Steele et al.,2017) is useful but expensive.
  
  - High resolution satellite imagery are becoming cheaper but highly unstructured and contains measurement error (Jean et al., 2016; Donaldson and Storeygard, 2016). 
  
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models (Jean et al., 2016; Babenko et al. 2017) can explain an average of 46% of the variation at village level but they require an enormous amount of training data and are computational extensive. Interpret-ability and repeat-ability are not that promising (Engstrom,2018).
   
## Framework

- Understanding of the food security. The definition of food security has various characteristics. The use metrics can lead to quite divergent rankings of the same population (Steele et al. 2017)

- Geo-referenced household surveys (LSMS data) allow us to explore the spatial-temporal variations in food security measures.

- The sampling framework in these surveys made it possible for us to observe a nationally representative sample in different months and agroecological zones. 

- Explain these variations by the spatial-temporal variation in food availability and in food access.
    + Align weather data to crop growing season 
    + Align households to the most relevant market price

## Discussion on the types of regression models 

## Data
 
 - Price data (maize and cassava)
 
 - Weather 
   + first day of rainfall
   + rainfall in growing season
   + maximum of days without rain 
   + temperature: growing degree days 
   
 - Soil quality: Slope, water, soil nutrition 
 
 - Roof/floor type, household asset index
 
 
## Modelling strategy
 
 - sets of models deal with high dimensional problem with regularization:
    + Lasso
    + Ridge
    + Elastic Net
 
 - models that are great with heterogeneous distribution of data: 
    + Random Forest 
    + Bagging / boosting 

## Main Results

 - scatter plots 



## Future Steps 
 - Vary the time gap between training and testing ( train and test on the a subset of data that are only several weeks/month apart)
 - Trained on a pooled data set across different countries V.S. Fit models on each individual country with the same procedure
 - Predict "now": countries/areas that are not surveyed and suggest areas that are likely to have a food shortage. 
 
### Limitations 
 - Gradual food insecure compared to sudden, abrupt threat to food security (natural disaster, war and conflict)
