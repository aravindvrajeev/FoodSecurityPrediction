## Research Question

- Can we build an early warning system of food security in areas where data is scarce and data collection is costly ? (Hutchinson,1991)
    + 
    + 
    
- Can we make use of publicly available and economically meaningful data? 
    + Price data of the main agricultural markets are collected monthly or weekly 
    + Precipitation/temperature/soil quality from satellite imagery are relevant to agricultural production 
   
 - Can supervised learning methods have higher predicative power than linear models ?

## Preview of Results

  - Predictions from our model explains 50%-70% of cluster level variation and the result is consistent across three different countries in different years. 
  - Validation of  "A Prototype for Predicting Food Insecurity Using Readily Available Data" paper with three countries and several years of data 
  - Using the same type of variables, a tuned machine learning model outperforms a baseline linear model by xylem %. 
    
## Literature Review

  - Night lights data (Chen and Nordhaus 2011;Henderson,Storeygard andd Weil. 2012.;)is noisy and variation is little in areas of the extreme poor 
  - Mobile phone data (Blumenstock et al.,2015; Steele et al.,2017) is useful but expensive
  - High resolution satellite imagery are cheap but highly unstructured and contains measurement error (Donaldson and Storeygard, 2016). 
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models (Jean et al., 2016; Babenko et al. 2017) requires require an enormous amount of training
data and are computational extensive. Interpretability and repeatability of the CNN models are not that promising (Engstrom,2018).
   
## Framework

- Geo-referenced household surveys (LSMS) allow us to explore the spatial-temporal  
- Align weather data with cropland calendar
- Align households to the most relevant price
- 

## Temporal Variation

```{r out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("output/graphs/fsbymonth_malawi.pdf","output/graphs/seasonal-calendar-malawi.png"))
```


## Temporal Variation

```{r out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("output/graphs/fsbymonth_uganda.pdf","output/graphs/seasonal-calendar-uganda.png"))
```

## Discussion on the types of regression models 

## Data

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Modelling strategy

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```


## Main Results

 - scatter plots 

## Future Steps 
 - Vary the time gap between training and testing ( train and test on the a subset of data that are only several weeks/month apart)
 - Trained on a pooled data set across different countries V.S. Fit models on each individual country with the same procedure
 - Predict "now": countries/areas that are not surveyed and suggest areas that are likely to have a food shortage. 
 
### Limitations 
 - Gradual food insecure compared to sudden, abrupt threat to food security (natural disaster, war and conflict) 
 
 -
